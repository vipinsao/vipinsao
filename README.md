## 🚀 What I'm Building Right Now

I'm currently obsessed with **GenAI integration in web applications** — not just adding ChatGPT wrappers, but building tools that use AI to solve specific, real-world problems. After months of experimenting with various AI APIs (Groq, Gemini, OpenAI) and building automation workflows with n8n, I've realized something: **the future isn't about AI replacing us, it's about AI embedded into applications making our daily tasks effortless**.

**Current tech focus:**
- **Frontend:** React + Next.js (because server-side rendering + client interactions = 🔥)
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express for APIs (experimenting with Python FastAPI for ML integrations)
- **AI/GenAI:** Integrating Gemini AI, OpenAI, Groq into full-stack apps
- **Learning:** AWS Cloud Practitioner cert, Docker containerization, system design patterns

I also write technical articles on [Dev.to](https://dev.to/vipin_sao) and [Medium](https://medium.com/@vipinc.sao) — not for the clout, but because writing forces me to really understand what I'm building. If someone learns from it, that's a bonus.

## 💡 Why I Build What I Build

Every project I create starts with a personal frustration or a problem I notice around me:

**Smart Ingredient Analyzer** → Got tired of not knowing what's actually in packaged food. Is it healthy or just clever marketing? Built an AI tool to find out in seconds.

**AI Interview Agent** → Mock interviews are expensive and scheduling sucks. Why not have an AI conduct practice interviews 24/7 and give instant feedback?

**Automation workflows** → Spending hours on repetitive tasks like posting jobs or scheduling tweets? Automated it with n8n. Now those hours go into actually building.

I don't code to pad my resume. **I code because there's a problem I want solved**, and if the solution doesn't exist, I'll build it myself.

## 🎯 Projects That Show What I Can Do

### 🧠 [Smart Ingredient Analyzer](https://github.com/vipinsao/Smart-Ingredient-Analyzer)
**What it does:** Uses OCR to scan food labels, extracts ingredients, and analyzes them with Gemini AI for health insights.

**Why I built it:** I wanted to make healthier food choices but reading ingredient lists felt like decoding a science textbook.

**Tech stack:** Next.js, OpenAI API, Gemini AI, TailwindCSS  
**Status:** ✅ Live → [Try it here](https://smart-ingredient-analyzer.vercel.app)

**Biggest challenge:** Getting accurate OCR from phone-captured images. Spent days tweaking preprocessing steps and API parameters until it worked consistently.

---

### 🎤 [AI Interview Agent](https://github.com/vipinsao/ai-interview-agent)
**What it does:** Users input job details and preferences, then get connected to an AI voice agent that conducts a mock interview and provides instant feedback.

**Why I built it:** Wanted to practice interviews but couldn't afford expensive mock interview services. Built my own.

**Tech stack:** JavaScript, Vapi AI, Voice API integration  
**Status:** ✅ Live → [Try it here](https://ai-interview-agent-gules.vercel.app/)

**What I learned:** Voice-based AI needs careful prompt engineering to maintain natural conversation flow. Getting the AI to "sound human" took way more iterations than I expected.

---

### 🎨 [My Portfolio](https://github.com/vipinsao/Portfolio_Latest)
**What it does:** Personal portfolio with smooth animations and clean UI showcasing my work.

**Why I built it:** Needed a professional online presence that actually represents who I am — not just another generic Bootstrap template.

**Tech stack:** Next.js, TailwindCSS, Framer Motion  
**Status:** ✅ Live → [Check it out](https://portfolio-latest-y5jf.vercel.app)

### 🎮 More Projects Worth Checking Out

- **[OpenMind AI Agent](https://github.com/vipinsao/openmind-ai-agent)** — Real-time AI assistant with context-aware responses (Google Gemini API)
- **[AI SaaS WebApp](https://github.com/vipinsao/ai-saas-webapp)** — Video compression tool using Cloudinary with auto-highlighting
- **[TypingWeb](https://github.com/vipinsao/typingweb)** — Typing practice app with Easy/Medium/Hard modes + Firebase Auth

## 📝 Writing & Sharing Knowledge

I write technical articles to solidify my own understanding and (hopefully) help others learn faster than I did.

**Recent articles:**
- 📌 [JavaScript vs TypeScript – Why Everyone's Shifting to TypeScript in 2025](https://dev.to/vipin_sao/javascript-vs-typescript-why-everyones-shifting-to-typescript-in-2025-3f50) — Dev.to
- 📌 More articles coming soon on [Medium](https://medium.com/@vipinc.sao) about GenAI integration patterns, n8n automation workflows, and full-stack architecture decisions

**Why I write:**
- Forces me to understand concepts at a deeper level
- Creates a record of my learning journey
- Helps other developers who face the same problems

## 🛠️ Technologies I Actually Use

</p>

**Note:** These aren't just badges I collected. These are tools I use regularly and feel confident building production-ready apps with. If it's here, I've shipped real projects using it.

## 🌱 What Makes Me Different

Here's the thing: **I'm not just learning to code — I'm learning to build.**

There's a huge difference between following tutorials and actually building something users would want to use. I focus on:

✅ **Shipping functional projects**, not just collecting GitHub stars  
✅ **Solving real problems** that I or people around me actually face  
✅ **User experience matters** — what's the point if nobody wants to use it?  
✅ **Writing about my process** — transparently sharing what I build and what I learn  
✅ **No copy-paste mentality** — I understand the concepts, then apply them my way

Also, I'm a huge **anime fan** (Dragon Ball and Demon Slayer are my go-tos). When I'm not coding or writing, I'm probably watching anime or brainstorming the next project idea.

---

## 🎯 What I'm Looking For

I'm actively seeking **remote opportunities** where I can contribute as a **Full Stack Developer** or **Software Developer**. I want to work with teams that:

✅ **Build products that matter** — solving real problems, not just chasing trends  
✅ **Value learning over credentials** — growth mindset > "X years of experience"  
✅ **Embrace modern tech** — open to AI/GenAI integration, automation, and experimentation  
✅ **Encourage ownership** — let developers take ideas from concept to deployment  

**Location:** Raipur, India (fully open to remote work globally)  
**Ideal roles:** Full Stack Developer, SDE, Frontend/Backend Engineer, AI Integration Engineer
